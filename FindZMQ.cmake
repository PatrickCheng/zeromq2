# - Find an ZMQ installation or build tree.

# When ZMQ is found, the ZMQConfig.cmake file is sourced to setup the
# location and configuration of ZMQ.  Please read this file, or
# ZMQConfig.cmake.in from the ZMQ source tree for the full list of
# definitions.  Of particular interest is ZMQ_USE_FILE, a CMake source file
# that can be included to set the include directories, library directories,
# and preprocessor macros.  In addition to the variables read from
# ZMQConfig.cmake, this find module also defines
#  ZMQ_DIR  - The directory containing ZMQConfig.cmake.  
#             This is either the root of the build tree, 
#             or the CTK/CMakeExternals/Build/ZMQ directory.  
#             This is the only cache entry.
#   
#  ZMQ_FOUND - Whether ZMQ was found.  If this is true, 
#              ZMQ_DIR is okay.
#
#  USE_ZMQ_FILE - The full path to the ZMQ.cmake file.  
#                 This is provided for backward 
#                 compatability.  Use ZMQ_USE_FILE
#                 instead.
